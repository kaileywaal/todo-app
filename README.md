Welcome to my todo app!

This is my solution to the [Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### Useful resources

- [Rounded linear gradient on hover](https://gist.github.com/stereokai/36dc0095b9d24ce93b045e2ddc60d7a0#file-gistfile1-txt) - This helped me figure out how to make a rounded linear gradient for the checkboxes.
